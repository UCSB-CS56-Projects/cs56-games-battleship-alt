cs56-games-battleship-alt
=========================

An alternative version of Battleship.    (Eventually, the two should be refactored into ONE.)

<b>TODO</b> - add more description to the sections of this README

This is a command line version of the game Battleship. 
* Original developer description - the Milton Bradley board game that has won the hearts of children for over four decades. It will be single-player (vs. computer) and will have various difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard).  You can also host/join games and play against your friends online WITH THE POWER OF JAVA NETWORKING!

The code can also be found at these links

A massage from the last editor:
When I first started reading this code, I got kind confused becuase this readme almost told nothing about what need to be done. And the code were very messy. I'm a little sorry that I think I do not have much ability to clean up those code. I hope next editor(s) can clean up the code. But, I hope the clean up should be the extra credit because they are too hard to clean up. eh.. I think I says too much nonsense. Now I am talking something useful.

Suggentions:
1. Don't look at the build.xml. It is too hard too understand. Read it if you want(?)
2. The main class is in the Battleship.java (I was trying to find the main class in build.xml but failed) so you can start there
3. If you never played this game before, you can first try it. (I never played this game before and there were many GUI bugs in the program and there was no instruction so I was confused when I started it.)

What is done in the last version(my version)
1. GUI bugs are all fixed (this was the biggest issue)
2. Host/Join are more friendly. No stuck when listening or no instantly exit when cannot connect.
3. Added a counter how many round player wined or lost.
4. Added whose turn now is

What need to be done: (this is the most important part for the next student)
1. This game do not have the real "play it online". The online part is still play locally. So, the next to be done is to make it play online. (I think this one worth at least 600 point because the programmer need do both hoster and joiner part)
2. Add more for statistics. Forexample, keep a save data to save the total wins or loses even when the player quit. Or you can add more features in the menu.
3. Not sure if my version have other bugs

Because I edit the codes with eclipse, the files may contain some eclipse files I might not clean up.
Last of all, sorry if my english is bad. :)
わが生涯に一片の悔い無し！
